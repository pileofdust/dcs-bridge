# DCS Bridge
Bridging the gap between supporting tools and DCS

The full and immersive DCS experience usually includes a number of supporting applications and tools for mission planning, kneeboard generation, campaign status and team communication. In VR it is challenging to stich all this together without going back to the real world and the mouse and the keyboard. 

DCS Bridge is a tool to help stich it all together, making it possible to stay in the virtual world between sorties. The tool will also help with loading the mission plan into the aircraft mission computer while we are waiting for ED to implement the data cartridge functionality. 

Currently the tool only supports the F-16, but can easily be extended to support other airframes.
